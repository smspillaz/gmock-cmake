# FindGMOCK.cmake
#
# This CMake script will search for or add an external project target
# for both Google Test and Google Mock. It sets the following variables:
#
# GOOGLE_MOCK_FOUND: Whether Google Test and Mock were found
# GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR : Include directory containing gtest/gtest.h
# GMOCK_INCLUDE_DIR : Include directory containing gmock/gmock.h
# GTEST_LIBRARY : Linker line for the Google Test library
# GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY : Linker line for the Google Test main () library.
#                      You should only link with this library if you do not
#                      need to overload the testing environment with a
#                      custom one.
# GMOCK_LIBRARY : Linker line for the Google Mock library
# GMOCK_MAIN_LIBRARY : Linker line for the Google Mock main () library.
#                      You should only link with this library if you do not
#                      need to overload the testing environment with a
#                      custom one.
# GTEST_BOTH_LIBRARIES : Convenience variable containing the result of both
#                        ${GTEST_LIBRARY} and ${GMOCK_LIBRARY} as well as any
#                        pthread libraries required for Google Test's operation.
#
# There is some trickiness that comes with setting up both Google Test and
# Google Mock. Different vendors tend to ship it in different ways.
#
# 0. A parent directory could have build Google Test and Google Mock,
#    and have provided us with the relevant paths in the form of
#    the following options:
#
#    GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR
#    GMOCK_INCLUDE_DIR
#    GTEST_LIBRARY_LOCATION
#    GMOCK_LIBRARY_LOCATION
#    GTEST_MAIN_LIBRARY_LOCATION
#    GMOCK_MAIN_LIBRARY_LOCATION
#
# 1. Google Test and Google Mock are shipped as a pre-built library
#    in which case we can use both and set the include dirs.
# 2. Google Mock is shipped as a pre-built library, but Google Test
#    is shipped in source-form, in which case the latter must be built
#    from source and the former linked in.
# 3. Only Google Mock is shipped in source-form, including a distribution
#    of Google Test. Both must be built and linked in.
# 4. It may not be shipped or available at all, in which case, we must
#    add an external project rule to download, configure and build it
#    at build time. We then import the resultant library.
#
#    We can do this by either:
#    a) Building using SVN
#    b) Downloading a released version.
#
# The C++ One Definition Rule requires that all symbols have the same
# definition at link time. If they do not, then multiple copies of the
# symbols will be created and this will lead to undefined and unwanted
# behaviour. If you plan to alter the definitions provided in the
# Google Mock or Google Test header files by changing preprocessor
# definitions, then you almost certainly do not want to link with a
# pre-built system Google Mock or Google Test which would have been
# built with different definitions. As such, you should consider
# changing the following option:
#
# GTEST_PREFER_SOURCE_BUILD : Whether or not to prefer a source build of
#                             Google Test.
# GMOCK_PREFER_SOURCE_BUILD : Whether or not to prefer a source build of
#                             Google Mock.
# GMOCK_ALWAYS_DOWNLOAD_SOURCES : Whether to always download the Google Mock
#                                 sources if building Google Mock, as opposed
#                                 to using the sources shipped on the system.
# GMOCK_DOWNLOAD_VERSION : If downloading Google Mock, which version to download
#                          (defaults to SVN)
# GMOCK_FORCE_UPDATE : If downloading from SVN, whether or not to run the 
#                      update step, which is not run by default.
